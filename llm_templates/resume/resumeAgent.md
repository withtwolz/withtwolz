# Generic Resume Optimization Template

## Purpose

This template provides guidelines for tailoring a resume to any job description (JD). It focuses on ATS optimization, bullet conciseness, keyword matching, and strategic positioning.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Bullet Point Length**

-   **Ideal:** 12-15 words (most scannable)
-   **Acceptable:** 16-20 words
-   **Too long:** 21+ words (trim or split)

**Rules:**

-   Remove filler words: closely, timely, across, that, in order to, really, very
-   Use active verbs: built, developed, designed, implemented, automated
-   Avoid passive voice: "was responsible for" → "built"
-   One idea per bullet maximum

---

### 2. **ATS Keyword Matching**

**Process:**

1. Extract 10-15 critical keywords from the JD (skills, tools, methodologies)
2. Mirror exact terminology where possible (e.g., if JD says "integration testing," use "integration testing" not "integration tests")
3. Place keywords in:
    - Summary (3-5 keywords)
    - Skills section (all relevant keywords)
    - Bullets (naturally integrated, not forced)

**Keyword Categories to Extract:**

-   Technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)
-   Methodologies (Agile, CI/CD, test strategies)
-   Soft skills (collaboration, debugging, mentorship)
-   Domain knowledge (mobile, web, API, data pipelines)
-   Specific tools mentioned (Jira, Jenkins, Selenium, etc.)

---

### 3. **Summary Optimization**

**Formula:**
`[Job Title] with [X years/experience descriptor] [doing what] for [what type of systems]. Expert in [3-4 key skills from JD]. Experienced with [2-3 tools/methodologies from JD].`

**Examples:**

For SDET role:

> Software Development Engineer in Test with 10+ years building test automation frameworks for distributed systems. Expert in Python/TypeScript automation (Pytest, Playwright), CI/CD integration, and test infrastructure. Experienced with Kubernetes, Jenkins, and shift-left testing practices.

For QA Engineer role:

> Test Engineer with extensive experience in manual and automated testing for web applications at scale. Expert in Python automation (Selenium, Pytest), test plan design, and quality processes. Experienced with Jenkins CI/CD, Docker, and agile collaboration.

**Title Matching Rules:**

-   If JD says "SDET" → Use "Software Development Engineer in Test"
-   If JD says "QA Engineer" → Use "Test Engineer" or "QA Engineer"
-   If JD says "Software Test Engineer" → Use "Software Test Engineer"
-   Never use "Leader," "Manager," or "Specialist" for IC roles

---

### 4. **Skills Section Structure**

**Optimal Order (adjust based on JD emphasis):**

```
Programming Languages: [List languages mentioned in JD first]
Test Automation Frameworks: [If JD emphasizes frameworks, create separate section]
Testing Tools: [Tools from JD first, then your others]
Test Management: [If JD mentions Jira, TestRail, etc.]
CI/CD & DevOps: [Tools from JD first]
Technologies: [Backend/frontend tech from JD]
Platforms: [Cloud, collaboration tools]
Test Strategies: [Match JD terminology exactly]
```

**Rules:**

-   Lead each section with JD keywords
-   Remove irrelevant skills for the role
-   Add sections if JD emphasizes specific categories (e.g., "Data & Monitoring" for data roles)

---

### 5. **Bullet Point Optimization**

**Action Verb Hierarchy:**

**Strong (use these):**

-   Built, Developed, Designed, Architected, Engineered
-   Implemented, Created, Established, Automated
-   Reduced, Increased, Improved, Accelerated
-   Led, Drove, Enabled, Streamlined

**Weak (avoid these):**

-   Responsible for, Tasked with, Worked on
-   Helped with, Assisted in, Participated in
-   Managed (unless actually managing people)

**Bullet Formula:**
`[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [With What Tools/Tech] + [Resulting in Metric/Impact]`

**Examples:**

❌ **Too vague:**

> Worked on test automation for the backend systems to improve quality.

✅ **Good:**

> Built Python test framework (Pytest) with 100+ automated tests, reducing regression time by 75%.

---

**Quantification Rules:**

-   Always include metrics where possible: percentages, time saved, volume (# of tests, releases, etc.)
-   If you don't have exact numbers, estimate conservatively
-   Format: "X to Y" or "by Z%" or "(before → after)"

**Examples:**

-   "30 to 7 minutes" ✅
-   "by 75%" ✅
-   "(72h → 12h)" ✅
-   "83% reduction" ✅

---

### 6. **Work Experience Bullet Reordering**

**Rule:** Most recent role should lead with bullets most relevant to the target JD.

**Process:**

1. Read the JD's "Key Responsibilities" or "What You'll Do" section
2. Identify the top 3-5 responsibilities
3. Reorder your bullets so the most relevant appear first
4. Remove or de-emphasize bullets that don't match

**Example:**

**JD emphasizes:** Test automation, CI/CD, mobile testing

**Your bullets should be ordered:**

1. Test automation framework work (most relevant)
2. CI/CD integration (very relevant)
3. Mobile testing (very relevant)
4. Bug triage (somewhat relevant)
5. Load testing (least relevant - consider removing)

---

### 7. **Common Adjustments by Role Type**

**For Backend/API SDET roles:**

-   Emphasize: REST API testing, CI/CD, Python/TypeScript, integration tests
-   De-emphasize: Mobile automation, frontend testing
-   Remove: Marketing campaigns, manual testing focus

**For Mobile QA roles:**

-   Emphasize: Appium, iOS/Android, cross-platform testing
-   De-emphasize: Backend infrastructure, load testing
-   Remove: Data pipelines, algorithm validation

**For Infrastructure/Platform roles:**

-   Emphasize: Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, test infrastructure
-   De-emphasize: Manual testing, test case creation
-   Remove: Mobile specifics, marketing campaigns

**For Manual QA roles:**

-   Emphasize: Test plan design, exploratory testing, bug triage, test case creation
-   De-emphasize: Complex automation, infrastructure work
-   Remove: Heavy CI/CD, Kubernetes details

**For Full-Stack/End-to-End roles:**

-   Emphasize: Breadth (mobile + backend + frontend), system integration
-   Balance: Automation and manual testing
-   Include: Multi-component system experience

---

### 8. **Removing Overqualification Signals**

**If applying to mid-level roles (2-5 years) but you have 10+:**

**Remove/Change:**

-   ❌ "10+ years" from summary
-   ❌ "Senior" from title
-   ❌ "Lead" or "Manager" anywhere
-   ❌ Team building, hiring, mentorship bullets
-   ❌ Org-wide initiatives, company strategy

**Keep/Add:**

-   ✅ Hands-on technical work
-   ✅ Framework building, code writing
-   ✅ Individual contribution depth
-   ✅ "Extensive experience" instead of "10+ years"

---

### 9. **Addressing Resume Gaps**

**Missing skills in JD that you don't have:**

**If critical (listed in "Required" or mentioned 3+ times):**

-   If you've done similar work, reframe to match their terminology
-   If you haven't, consider if the role is a good fit

**If nice-to-have (listed in "Preferred" or mentioned once):**

-   Add to skills as "familiar with" if you've touched it briefly
-   Address in cover letter: "While I haven't used [X] specifically, I have extensive experience with [similar Y]"
-   Don't fabricate experience

---

### 10. **One-Page vs. Two-Page Decision**

**One page when:**

-   Applying to IC roles
-   8-12 years of relevant experience
-   Targeting startups or fast-moving companies
-   Most recent 2-3 roles cover 80%+ of relevant skills

**Two pages when:**

-   Applying to very senior IC or staff roles (10-15+ years explicitly required)
-   Complex, diverse background across multiple domains
-   Targeting large enterprises (government, defense, finance)
-   Leadership roles (actual management, not IC)

**For most IC SDET/QA roles: One page is optimal.**
